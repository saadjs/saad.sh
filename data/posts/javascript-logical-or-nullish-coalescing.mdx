When checking out JavaScript code, we will see lots of `||` (Logical OR) but not so many `??` (Nullish Coalescing) operators for setting default values. So what's the real difference between them?

# Logical OR (`||`)

The OR operator uses the right value if the left is `falsy`.

So what are the `falsy` values in JavaScript?

There are a few but most common ones we come across include `null`, `undefined`, `false`, `NaN`, `0`, and `""`. ([Full list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy))

So what's the problem?

Let's look at few examples:

Example 1:

```js
let result = false || true // result = true
```

No real advantage here, so far so good!

Example 2:

```js
let result = '' || 'default' // result = ?
```

Since an empty string is `falsy`, `result = "default"` which may not be intended!

Example 3:

```js
const item = {
  price: 10,
  discountedPrice: 4.99,
}
const price = item.discountedPrice || item.price // price = 4.99
```

But

```js
const item2 = {
  price: 10,
  discountedPrice: 0,
}
const price2 = item2.discountedPrice || item2.price // price2 = 10 ü§∑üèª
```

Item2's price should be `0`, item2 should be FREE, why is it `10`?

Since `0` is a falsy value, default price becomes `10`!

Need a better alternative! Enter ??

# Nullish Coalescing (`??`)

The nullish coalescing operator uses the right value ONLY when left is `null` or `undefined`, and does not consider any other falsy values (i.e. `0`, `-0`, `""`, etc).

So all of the weird things from above examples are automatically taken care of.

```js
let result = '' ?? 'default' // result = ""

const item2 = {
  price: 10,
  discountedPrice: 0,
}
const price2 = item2.discountedPrice ?? item2.price // price = 0 üéâ
```

In the world of JavaScript, mastering the little things can make a big difference. While understanding the nuances between `||` (Logical OR) and `??` (Nullish Coalescing) operators may not change your life, it can certainly help minimize bugs.

Happy Coding!
