User `DateTime`'s `weekday` getter.

- 1 for Monday
- 2 for Tuesday
  ...

```dart
// Today
DateTime now = DateTime.now();

// Get most recent Monday
DateTime mon = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day - (now.weekday - 1));

// Get most recent Wednesday
DateTime wed = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day - (now.weekday - 3));

// Get Sunday
DateTime sun = DateTime(now.year, now.month, now.day - (now.weekday - 7));
