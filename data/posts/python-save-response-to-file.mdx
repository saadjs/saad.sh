## For text response: use `response.text`

```python
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/saadjs")

with open("response.txt", "w") as f: # 'w' for write file permission
    f.write(response.text)
```

## To append to a file:

```python
response = requests.get("https://api.github.com/users/saadjs")

with open("response.txt", "a") as f: # 'a' for append file permission
    f.write(response.text)
```
